# Purdue-CAT
Purdue Coding and Testing is a software system with the goal of facilitating coding education, competition, and self-improvement.
## Feature Goals

- Convenient API, allowing any type of interface to be created and ease of access to results
- Flexible grading, allowing code to be graded in a number of ways like output matching and functionality
- Easy administration, allowing institutions to host their own instance
